1. Python is pretty easy to learn; good places to start are:
    * The official [Python tutorial][python tutorial link] for a quick start guide.
    * If you're a __MATLAB__ user, the [Numpy for MATLAB users][numpy for matlab link] documentation.
    * If you're a language stickler, check out the [Python style guide][pep 8 link].
2. We recommend installing Python 3.x, as Python 2.7 is [no longer being updated][python 2 vs 3 link].
3. We installed a Python 3.x distribution by way of [Anadonda][anaconda link].
    * One of the most useful aspects of Anaconda is [`conda`][conda link].
        * `conda` is an open source package manager that keeps all Python dependencies in check
        * Maybe the best part:  It doesn't require root permission to install, so you can always have a trustworthy Python installation where you have a home directory
    * __REMINDER__: To open Python, just type `python` the command line, or launch the Anaconda Navigator application that is installed with Anaconda.
4. We learned about [Jupyter Notebook][what is jupyter notebook link] and messed around with our first [notebook file][intro notebook link].
    * __REMINDER__: To open Jupyter Notebook, type `jupyter notebook` on the command line __from the folder you want to run it in__.
    * You can also use [Interactive Python][interactive python link] by typing `ipython` on the command line.
