1. Python is pretty easy to learn; it's a matter of going through official tutorials and searching for your questions on Stack Overflow
    * Check out the official [Python tutorial][python tutorial link] for a quick start guide
    * If you're a __MATLAB__ user, read through the [Numpy for MATLAB users][numpy for matlab link] documentation
2. We recommend installing Python 3.x, as Python 2.7 is becoming legacy
3. We installed a Python 3.x distribution by way of [Anadonda][anaconda link]
    * One of the most useful aspects of Anaconda is [`conda`][conda link]
        * `conda` is an open osurce package manager that keeps all Python dependencies in check
        * Maybe the best part:  It doesn't require root permission to install, so you can always have a trustworthy Python installation on a computer
    * __REMINDER__: To open Python, just type `python` the command line, or launch the Anaconda Navigator application that is installed with Anaconda
4. We learned about [Jupyter Notebook][what is jupyter notebook link] and messed around with our first [notebook file][intro notebook link]
    * __REMINDER__: To open Jupyter Notebook, type `jupyter notebook` on the command line
